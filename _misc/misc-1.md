JP: 
> You're in a damaged structure, you're a damaged structure, you're ina damaged structure.

JP:
> It has to be that the fragility is built into the courage. If it wasn't the case that you could be hurt or ended up
> in failure, where is the moral courage in the endeavour.

JP:
> In many sense, you're made of the unknown. The more you voluntarily encounter it, the more you get made of it. The
> more you get made of, there more is to you.

JP:
> You need an antidote to your suffering.

CW:
> Action is the antidote to anxiety

JW:
> If you're afraid of doing something. Do it anyway. That's the response to fear.

Job in the midst of his suffering:

> __I will do good no matter what. No matter what happens to me. No matter how much suffering comes my way.
> No matter how much _undeserved_ and _unjust_ suffering comes my way, in spite my of _innocence_. I will not lose faith 
> and I will do good.__

JP:
> You have to spend your life developing your character.

JP:
> So now Pinocchio has to face the thing he's afraid the most!

A truth by JP that I have experienced as well:
> Everything I actually did, paid off! 

TT:
> Solving a math problem isn't about winning or losing; it's about if you learned something from it.

WC:
> Succes is the ability tp go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.
