In non-theory research papers, I often see that the optimal (deterministic Markov) policy for MDPs is defined as 

$$\pi^* \in \arg\max_\pi v_\pi(s), \quad \forall s \in S,$$

where for a real-valued function $g$ on set $X$ $\arg\max$ is defined as 

$$\arg\max_{x \in X} g(x) := \{x' \in X: g(x') \geq g(x), \: \forall x \in X \}.$$

But, if the $\max$ is unattainable the definition of the optimal policy is ill-defined. To rectify that, we can define the optimal policy $\pi^*$ as the policy  such that

$$v^*: = v_{\pi^*}(s) = \sup_\pi v_\pi(s), \quad \forall s \in S.$$

In this post, I wanna dig into Proposition 4.4.3 in [Martin L. Puterman's book](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470316887). So, here is the question: __When is the supremum defined below attainable, i.e., $\sup = \max$?__

$$u^*_t(h_t) = \sup_{a \in A_s} \left\{r_t(s_t, a) + \sum_{j \in S}p_t(j \mid s_t, a)u^*_{t + 1}(h_t, a, j)\right\}.$$

In the above display, $u_t^*$ is optimal history dependent value function at time step $t$, $h_t = s_0, a_0, \dots, s_t$ is the history until time step $t$, $s_t$ is the state at time step $t$, $r_t$ is the deterministic reward function at time step $t$, $p_t$ is the transition dynamics at time step $t$, and $A_s$ is the set of available actions at state $s \in S$. 

Let's first revisit the background we need.

# Background

We will take limits, hence we need to make sure we can. For this, we need define the concepts of completeness and separability. I've already defined completeness in [this post about Sobolev space](https://alirezakazemipour.github.io/posts/2025/08/sblv/), so I only revisit separability here.

## A separable metric space

First we need to know what is a dense a set. 

____
### A dense set

Let $(X, D)$ be a metric space. Let $E \subset X$ be as subset and $\bar{E}$ be its closure. $E$ is dense if $\bar{E} = X$. 

____
A topological space X (which naturally can be thought of being generated by a metric distance that are open with respect to the metric distance) is separable if it has a countable dense subset, e.g., irrationals in reals. Or said differently: You can “approximate” any point in the space by points from a **countable subset**.

## Weak convergence

Let {$\mu_n$}$\_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of probability measures on $(X, \mathcal{F})$. We say that $\mu_n$ converges weakly to a probability measure $\mu$ on $(X, \mathcal{F})$ if $\int f d\mu_n = \int f d\mu$ for all bounded $\mathcal{F}$-measurable functions $f$.

## Semicontinuous functions (a.k.a. almost everywhere continuous functions, not jumpy functions)

First we need to know what an open set is.

___
### An open set

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Given any $x \in X$ and $r > 0$, define the open ball $B(x, r)$ centred at $x$ with radius $r$ to be the set of all $y \in X$ such that $d(x, y) < r$. Given a set $E$, we say $x$ is an interior point of $E$ if there is some open ball centred at $x$, which is contained in $E$. A set is open if every point is an interior point

Let $X$ be a complete separable metric space and $f$ a real-valued function on $X$. We say that $f$ is upper semicontinuous (u.s.c.) if, for any sequence $\{x_n\}$ of $X$'s elements which converges to $x^*$,

$$\lim\sup_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) \leq f(x^*).$$

Like

$$f(x) = \begin{cases}x + 1 & \mathrm{if}\, x = 1 \\ x & \mathrm{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

and $x_n \to 1$$. Similarly,
$f$ is said to be lower semicontinuous (l.s.c.) whenever $-f$ is u.s.c., or equivalently,
$\lim\inf_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) \geq f(x^*).$ A continuous function is both u.s.c and l.s.c. 

Function $c$ when $x_n \to 1$ is u.s.c and  $f(x) = \begin{cases}x + 1 & \mathrm{if}\, x > 1\\ x & \mathrm{if}\, x \leq 1\end{cases}$ when  $x_n \to 1$ is l.s.c. 

____
__Lemma__ 1. Let $X$ be a complete separable metric space. Then, 
1. If $f \geq 0$ and $g \geq 0$ are u.s.c. on $X$, then $fg$ is u.s.c. on $X$. 
2. If $f,g$ are u.s.c. on $X$, then $f + g$ is u.s.c. on X.
3. If $\{f_n\}$ is a decreasing sequence of nonpositive u.s.c. functions on $X$, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n$ is u.s.c. on $X$. 

_Proof_. [ChatGPT]

Part (1). 
One convenient characterization of upper semicontinuity is that: $h$ is u.s.c. iff for every $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, the set $\{x: h(x) < \alpha\}$ is open. 

We will show that for every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ the set $\{x \in X: f(x)g(x) < c\}$ is open. If $c \leq 0$, then $U_c = \varnothing$ because $f,g$ are nonnegative, and $\varnothing$ is open. So, fix $c > 0$. We have


$$\{x \in X: f(x)g(x) < c\} = \cup_{r > 0} \{x \in X: f(x) < r\; \mathrm{and} \;g(x) < \frac{c}{r}\}.$$

So, $f,g$ are u.s.c, the sets $\{x \in X: f(x) < r \} \; \mathrm{and} \; \{x \in x: g(x) < \frac{c}{r}\}$ are open for any $r$, hence their intersection is open, and the union of open sets are open. $\square$

Part (2). 
A proof can be given similar to Part (1), however the result is also immediate from the definition of u.s.c. 

Part(3).
Note that $f(x) := \lim_{n \to \infty}f_n(x) = \inf_{n}f_n(x)$. This indicates $f_1(x) \geq f_2(x) \geq \dots f_n(x) \geq \dots f(x)$. Hence since the sequence is decreasing, for each of the $f_n(x)$ that $f_n(x) < c$ holds, it will hold for all $m > n$, where $c$ is a real number. Hence,

$$\{x \in X:  f(x) < c\} = \cup_{n =1}^\infty \{x \in X:  f_n(x) < c\}.$$

The proof is completed by stating that since $f_n$s are u.s.c., $\{x \in X:  f_n(x) < c\}$ is open and the union of open sets is open. $\square$

__Proposition__ 1. Suppose $C$ is a compact subset of a complete separable metric space $X$, and $f$ is u.s.c. on $X$. Then there exists an $x^*$ in $C$ such that $f(x^*) \geq f(x)$ for all $x \in C.$

_Proof_. Let $y^* = \sup_{x \in C}f(x)$ and the corresponding $x$ by $x^\*$. Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence in $C$ for which $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = y^*$. Then, since $C$ is a compact subset of a complete separable metric space, there exits a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ which has a limit $x^*$. By since $f$ is u.s.c., then $f(x^*) \geq \lim_{k \to \infty}f(x_{n_k}) = y^*$. Hence, $f(x^*) = y^*$. $\square$ 

__Proposition__ 2. Let $X$ be a countable set, $Y$ a complete separable metric space and $q(x, y)$ a bounded nonnegative real-valued function that is l.s.c. in $y$ for each $x \in X$. Let, $f(x)$ be bounded nonpositive real-values function on $X$ for which $\sum_{x \in X}f(x)$ is finite. Then,

$$h(y) = \sum_{x \in X}f(x)q(x, y)$$

is u.s.c on $Y$. 

__Proof__. Based on the part (1) of the above Lemma 1, for each $x \in X, \; f(x)q(x, y) \leq 0$ is u.s.c. Let $\{x_n\}$ be an increasing sequence of finite subsets of $X$ such that $\cup_{n =1}^\infty X_n = X$. Then, by Lemma 1 we have that $h_n(y) := \sum_{x \in X_n} f(x)q(x, y)$ is u.s.c. in $y$ for each $n$. Since $h_n(y)$ is decreasing in $n$, by Part (3) of Lemma 1, $h(y) = \lim_{n \to \infty} h_n(y)$ is u.s.c. $\square$

The following corollary. generalizes the previous proposition to nondiscrete sets. Note that a kernel $q(\cdot \mid y)$ on Borel subset of $X$ is continuous if $q(\cdot \mid y_n)$ converges weakly to $q(\cdot \mid y)$ whenever ${y_n}$ converges to $y$. It means for a bounded measurable real-valued function $f$ on $X$,

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f(x) q(dx \mid y_n) = \int_X f(x)q(dx \mid y).$$

__Corollary__. 
Let $X, Y$ be complete separable metric spaces, $f(x)$ a bounded u.s.c. function on $X$, and $q(\cdot \mid y)$ a continuous kernel on the Borel sets of $X$. Then, $h(y) := \int_X f(x) q(dx \mid y)$ is u.s.c. on $Y$.

# Main body

__Proposition__. Assume $S$ is finite or countable, and that
1. $A_s$ is finite for each $s \in S$, or
2. $A_s$ is a compact subset of a complete separable metric space, $r_t(s, a)$ is continuous in $a$ for each $s \in S$, there exists an $M < \infty$ for which $\|r_t(s_t, a)\| < M$ for all $a \in A_s$ and $s \in S$, and $p_t(j \mid s, a )$ is continuous in $a$ for each $j \in S$ and $s \in S$  and $t = 1,2,. . . , N$, or
3. $A_s$ is a compact subset of a complete separable metric space, $r_t(s, a)$ is u.s.c. in $a$ for each $s \in S$, there exists an $M < \infty$ for which $\|r_t(s_t, a)\| < M$ for all $a \in A_s$ and $s \in S$, and $p_t(j \mid s, a )$ is l.s.c. in $a$ for each $j \in S$ and $s \in S$  and $t = 1,2,. . . , N$.
Then there exists a deterministic Markov policy which is optimal.

____
_Proof._

We need to show that for each state $s$, there exists an action $a' \in A_s$, for which

$$r_t(s, a') + \sum_{j \in S}p_t(j \mid s, a') u^*_{t + 1}(j) = \sup_{a \in A_s} \left\{r_t(s, a) + \sum_{j \in S}p_t(j \mid s, a) u^*_{t + 1}(j)\right\}.$$

If $A\_s$ is finite the result is immediate. So, Part (1) follows naturally. Now consider the setting of Part (3). Since $\|r_t(s_t, a)\| < M$ for all $a \in A_s$ and $s \in S$ and $t \in [N]$, Therefore, for each $t$, $u^*_t(s) - NM \leq 0$. Now we apply Proposition 2, where $X = S, f(x) = u^*_{t + 1}(x), \, \mathrm{and}\, q(x, y) = p_t(j \mid s, y)$ for a fixed state $x$. Then,

$$\sum_{j \in S}p_t(j \mid s, a)\left[u_{t + 1}^*(j) - NM\right]$$

is u.s.c., from which we can conclude that $\sum\_{j \in S}p_t(j \mid s, a)\left[u_{t + 1}^*(j)\right]$ is u.s.c. because shifting by a constant doesn't change the continuity. By, Part (2) of Lemma 1 we can conclude that $r_t(s, a) + \sum_{j \in S}p_t(j \mid s, a)\left[u_{t + 1}^*(j) \right]$ is u.s.c. in $a$ for each state $s$. Hence, by Proposition 1, the supermum over $A_s$ is attained. Part (2) is a special case of Part(3) since continuous functions are both upper and lower s.c. $\square$
