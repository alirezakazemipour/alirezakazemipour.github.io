What I learned from Clare Lyle at Finding the Frame workshop:
1. Clare is in pretty good shape, comparison to her made realize 
I defnitely should give my best to stay in a good _really_ shape.
2. She does blogging [here](https://clarelyle.com/archive.html)
explaining math/reesrch materissl and also life lessons. It made me realize I should do 
that too to have a clearer mind
3. As of August 5th, 2025, I'm learning stuff that she learned in her 2nd year of undergrad. This 
made me realize that I should temper my expectations, be much more humble, try harder to acquire those knowledge too.
4. She was asked: "How do you choose a topic/research question out of this huge world to do research on?"
Her answer:
> I usually take something that works really well and test it on a setting that it doesn't work
> well anymore. Then, I try to figure out why it isn't working. This
> Approach results in a cycle of questioning and answering that leads to interesting research.
