What I learned from Clare Lyle at Finding the Frame workshop:
1. Clare is in pretty good shape, comparison to her made realize 
I defnitely should give my best to stay in a good _really_ shape.
2. She does blogging [here](https://clarelyle.com/archive.html)
explaining math/reesrch materissl and also life lessons. It made me realize I should do 
that too to have a clearer mind
3. As of August 5th, 2025, I'm learning stuff that she learned in her [2nd year of undergrad](https://clarelyle.com/posts/2016-04-28-firstyearproofs.html). This made me realize that I should temper my
expectations, be much more humble, try harder to acquire those knowledge too. We've roughly started our undergrad at 
the same time and compared to how I was behaving in my 2nd year, she is miles ahead and throughout the years the drift 
has exponentially grown; _I shouldn't expect to close the gap overnight_.
4. She was asked: "How do you choose a topic/research question out of this huge world to do research on?"
Her answer:
> I usually take something that works really well and test it on a setting that it doesn't work
> well anymore. Then, I try to figure out why it isn't working. This
> Approach results in a cycle of questioning and answering that leads to interesting research.
